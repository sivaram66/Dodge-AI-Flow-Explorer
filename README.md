## What It Does

The system ingests a real SAP O2C dataset, models it as a graph of interconnected business entities, and lets users explore it visually and query it in natural language.

- **Graph Visualization** — 674 nodes (Sales Orders, Deliveries, Billing Documents, Journal Entries, Payments, Customers, Products, Plants) and 1,066 edges rendered as a force-directed graph. Click any node to inspect its metadata and relationships.
- **Conversational Query Interface** — Ask questions in plain English. The system translates them to SQL, executes against the real database, and streams back grounded answers. Referenced nodes highlight in the graph.
- **Guardrails** — Out-of-scope queries (general knowledge, math, creative writing) are rejected before reaching the LLM.

## Graph Navigation

One of the core features of this system is that every node 
is connected to related entities. You are not just viewing 
data — you are navigating a live graph. Clicking any 
connected item in the inspector opens that entity, letting 
you trace the complete business flow from one end to the 
other without typing a single query.
Letting you trace the complete O2C business flow from Customer → Sales Order → Delivery → Billing → Journal Entry without typing a single query.

## Node Highlighting

When you ask a question in the chat, every node referenced 
in the answer lights up in the graph in real time.

Ask "Which products have the most billing documents?" — 
the product nodes highlight gold.
The graph and the chat work together, not separately.

## Database Choice

**PostgreSQL on Neon** was chosen over SQLite for two reasons.

First, deployment. Free hosting platforms (Render, Railway) use ephemeral filesystems — SQLite files get wiped on every redeploy. Neon persists data independently of the application server.

Second, correctness. PostgreSQL's `NUMERIC(15,2)` type handles financial amounts without floating-point precision loss. SQLite's `REAL` type would silently corrupt values like `249.15` INR.

## Graph Data Model

### Node/Edge Decision Rule

A row becomes a **node** if it is an entity a user would click on and ask "tell me about this thing." It becomes an **edge** if its job is to connect two nodes.

### Two-Graph Architecture

The system maintains two graph objects in memory at startup:

- **Summary graph** — 8 nodes (one per entity type) with counts and flow edges. Served as the initial canvas render. Derived from the full graph in Python — no extra DB queries.
- **Full graph** — individual nodes keyed by ID (`O(1)` lookup for highlight), edge list, and a `by_type` index for expand-on-click.

This design avoids rendering 674 nodes on initial load while keeping the full graph available for chat-driven highlighting.

## LLM Prompting Strategy

### Two-Round Architecture

Every chat message goes through two LLM calls:

**Round 1 (planning):** A non-streaming call with `temperature=0` returns a JSON execution plan — a list of tool calls with parameters. If the user's message lacks required information (e.g. asks to trace a flow but provides no billing document ID), Round 1 returns `{"ask": "..."}` instead of steps, and the clarification is shown to the user without executing any SQL.

**Round 2 (streaming):** After tool results are collected, a streaming call with `temperature=0.1` and **no tools parameter** generates the final prose answer. Removing tools from Round 2 prevents the model from attempting a second tool call in XML format, which Groq rejects.

### Tool Design

Three fixed tools cover the required assignment queries with verified SQL:

- `get_top_products_by_billing_count` — verified against real data, returns top N products by billing document frequency
- `trace_document_flow` — full SO→Delivery→Billing→JournalEntry join using the correct item-table join chain
- `get_broken_flows` — UNION ALL of delivered-not-billed and billed-without-delivery using `NOT EXISTS` subqueries

A fourth tool, `execute_query`, handles everything else. It accepts LLM-generated SQL validated through a `sqlglot` AST parser before execution — checking statement type (SELECT only), table whitelist, and a 5-second `statement_timeout` for the dynamic path only.

## Guardrails

The guardrail system uses a two-layer approach.

**Layer 1 — Deterministic keyword patterns** run before any LLM call. A set of compiled regex patterns (`re.IGNORECASE`) immediately rejects messages matching phrases like `poem`, `write me`, `capital of`, `how does * work`, `explain what`, and arithmetic expressions. This handles the most obvious off-topic requests with zero latency and zero token cost.

**Layer 2 — LLM classifier** handles ambiguous cases. A fast, cheap model (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) with `temperature=0` and `max_tokens=80` returns `{"is_in_scope": bool, "reason": "..."}`. The classifier prompt uses a principle-based rule rather than a list of examples: a message is in scope only if all three conditions hold simultaneously — it requires a database query to answer, the data exists in this specific O2C dataset, and the answer cannot be given from general knowledge alone. On error or timeout, the classifier fails open (allows the message through) so a Groq outage does not kill the chat feature.
